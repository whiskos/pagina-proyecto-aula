        <h3> 1ª WHAT IS THE FIRST THING TO THINK ABOUT TO CREATE A GARDEN AT HOME?</h3>
        <p>The first thing is to see and know the conditions of the house to adapt it to real possibilities and to get the most out of it. The characteristics of our home will intuit the type of garden we can have. If we have a garden we can reserve an area to adapt it as an orchard, planting horticultural, fruit, aromatic and even some ornamental plants depending on the space available. In this type of garden, we can plant directly on the garden soil.</p>

        <h3>2ª IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE AN URBAN GARDEN IN ALL HOUSES?</h2>
        <P>Initially the answer is yes. If we have space and containers where we grow ornamental plants, they can be partially or totally replaced by horticultural, aromatic and even some fruit.
            Thanks to the efforts of many companies that manufacture gardening products, they have included in their catalog products adapted for the urban garden. Examples of them are the cultivation tables, special substrates for vegetables, hand tools, special fertilizers for fruit and vegetables, etc.
            </P>

        <h3>
            3ª CAN YOU CULTIVATE EVERYTHING? 
        </h2>
        
        <p>The answer is no. The space, location and cultivation containers are important limitations in this regard. Also the time available for their care since if we have long periods of absence, it makes their care enormously difficult: they are living beings with minimal but continuous care.
        </p>

    <h3>4ª CAN YOU GET PRODUCTS LIKE THOSE THAT GO OUT IN THE FIELD? OR IS PLANTING A GARDEN AT HOME A POOR QUALITY IMITATION?</h2>
    <p>We can say that well cultivated, even better. It is a joy to eat a freshly picked strawberry, tomato or radish.
        As in everything, when things are done well, the results are also good and even excellent.
        </p>
    <article>
        <h3>5ª IN SUMMER WHICH PLANT OR PLANTS NEED HEAT AND GROW BETTER IN THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR? WHY?</h2>
        <p>We have always heard the phrase "buy seasonal fruits and vegetables." This expression is key when we apply it in the urban garden. There are usually no greenhouses in it, so we must choose those crops that are typical of the season of the year that we are in.</p>

    <h3>7ª IS IT EASY TO GET THE PLANT TO GERMINATE? HOW LONG DOES YOUR CARE REQUIRE?</h2>
    <p>If we have experience, and this is achieved by insisting on cultivation, we will make our seedlings germinate successfully.
